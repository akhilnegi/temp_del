"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

"Silvex® 223-20-C is a fine particle size aluminum pigment dampened with mineral oil to minimize the potential for generating airborne pigment particles. This is an economical grade with cornflake geometry and wide particle size distribution range. Due to its fine particle size and broad particle size distribution, this grade is well suited for imparting opacity at low loading levels. This is an economical grade and can be used to create a muted masstone metallic appearance with good opacity at low cost. This grade is not recommended for use with chromatic pigments as it will not produce clean color effects. Although grade is based on leafing aluminum pigment, it will not exhibit leafing characteristics in most plastic applications.",Aluminium type

"Color bleed may be a problem in some instances, usually with the red colors. It can occur even though the pigment resin matrix is thermoset and insoluble, and the fluorescent dye is in solid solution throughout the pigment particles and not merely absorbed on the surface. Some solvents leach enough dye from the insoluble particles so that color transfer may be noticeable when the coating surface involved contains significant amounts of plasticizers.",Pigment treatment

Its metallic design features high whiteness, high brightness and flip- flop effect.",Pigment treatment
Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

"This pigment black can be used in a variety of coatings applications. It is recommended for underbody/underhood automotive, general industrial, or architectural trade sales applications where high jetness is not required. It is also recommended for use as a tinting black since the relatively large particle size allows for high loading while the high structure allows less mobility in the wet film of the applied coating. This reduces problems with floating and flooding in liquid tinting applications. It can be easily dispersed using a high speed disperser for liquid coatings or a single screw extruder for powder coatings.",Supply form

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti-settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Ferroxide® 206M is a unique, surface-treated, micronized yellow-shade precipitated red iron oxide used in liquid colorants, plastics, paper, adhesives, rubber and other uses. Precipitation creates a larger, more uniform, softer and less agglomerated primary particle for increased tint strength, cleaner and more saturated colors, less abrasion on equipment, resistance to flocculation and wide compatibility in oil and latex systems. Surface treatment and micronization improve rheology, gloss and haze, ease of dispersion and in-can stability. Ferroxide® 206M has high chroma, so it can replace a portion of organic, chromate or titanate pigments in selected applications. Ferroxide® 206M is color-stable below 200℃ (392ºF) and does not undergo any chemical change up to 1000℃ (1832ºF). It is of sufficient purity for use in articles that contact food (21CFR), but not suitable for direct coloration of food or cosmetics. It meets ASTM C979-82 standards for color pigments used in cement. All Ferroxide® colors are manufactured under strict QC and environmental controls for reliable and consistent quality, stable under exposure to sunlight UV radiation and are alkali, chemical and weather resistant. Package: 55 Lb. (25 Kg.) multiwall paper bags shrink-wrapped onto pallets of 2200 Lbs. (1000 Kgs.) Uses: Paint, plastics, rubber, colorants, powder coatings, coil coatings adhesives, vinyl, ink, and concrete.",multi

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

"DESCRIPTION: A brown-black powder produced by high temperature calcination. This pigment has good UV and visible opacity, high infrared reflection, is chemically inert, heat resistant, and stable to ultraviolet light. It is non- bleeding and non-migratory. It has low heat build-up and has exceptional durability and hiding power, and is generally used in applications where resistance to heat, light, and weather are needed. It is compatible with most resin systems and polymers, and is non-warping. Typical applications (non inclusive) are liquid and powder coatings, inks, dispersions, plastics, and other applications where equivalent pigment chemistry is used.",multi

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

"Mapico Yellow 1075A is a ferric oxide hydrate (FeOOH) manufactured in the Martin process, micronized for ease of dispersion in coating, colorant and plastic systems. It is a permanent, non-bleeding inert pigment with a very clean shade, low oil absorption and good heat resistance that disperses easily on high-speed equipment in coatings, colorants, plastics, paper, adhesives and other applications. Mapico Yellows are used alone and in combination with organic pigments to improve opacity, reduce formula cost and add UV resistance to coating and ink formulations. Mapico Yellow 1075A is color- stable in processing temperatures below 175℃ (350ºF). It is of sufficient high-purity that it can be used as a colorant in cosmetic, animal and pet food applications and in packaging or articles that come in contact with food (21CFR). All Mapico iron oxides are manufactured under strict QC and environmental controls for reliable and consistent quality, stable under exposure to sunlight and UV radiation and are alkali, chemical and weather resistant. They also meet or exceed ASTM C979- 82 standards for color pigments used in cement. Mapico Yellow 1075A is packaged in 50 pound multiwall paper bags and shrink-wrapped onto pallets of 2000 pounds. Uses: paint, plastics, rubber, colorants, powder coatings, cosmetics, pet foods, can coatings, adhesives, ink and concrete.",multi

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary.

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply form

"Burnt Powder Umber No.39 is a natural pigment. Burnt Powder Umber No.39 is a naturally occurring ore, which is milled into powder at our facilities in Cyprus. Visual tests are conducted on each lot to maximize consistency and quality. The resulting pigment produces a light brown shade with natural undertones in wood gain applications. Umbers are preferred colorants in furniture stains and high-quality wood finishes because of their transparency and ability to enhance wood grain appearance. Burnt Powder Umber No.39 is also used in medium-gloss coatings, artist paints, coatings processed on intensive dispersing equipment, liquid colorants, paper, plaster and stucco applications. In addition, it is suitable to colour products made with cement. It is stable under exposure to sunlight and UV radiation and is alkali, chemical and weather resistant. Burnt Powder Umber No.39 is packaged in 25 kg multiwall paper bags and shrink-wrapped onto pallets of 40 bags (1000 kg). Uses: wood stain, paint, colorants, adhesives, ink, concrete, stucco and plaster.",Supply form

"It has excellent chemical resistance, outdoor durability, light fastness, heat stability and is non-bleeding and non-migratory. It is a all-purpose pigment, suggested applications include RPVC, Polyolefins, Engineering Resins. This pigment causes no warpage in injection-moulded or extruded parts - not even large ones. Its outstanding fastness ratings makes this pigment ideally expedient for plastics resistant to both weathering and heat, notably for shading as well as for mass tone. It make it particularly suitable for Paints and Coatings including General Industrial, Coil and Extrusion coatings. Another field of application are architectural finishes, both water- and solvent-based.",Pigment treatment

"The Mapico® Tan series is most commonly used in plastics. High temperature stability and ease of dispersion make these pigments suitable for resin systems from LLDPE and vinyl to sophisticated engineering polymers and silicone rubber compounds. Interactions of pigment and some resins in high-temp plastics compounding can lead to slight color shifts. Suitability of tan pigments should be verified for specific applications. Exterior durability is improved by the ultraviolet screening properties contributed by these pigments, especially with polymers that are sensitive to sunlight.

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary.

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary.

"Lysopac Yellow 7010C is a reddish yellow organic pigment, offering high opacity. Paints based on Yellow 7010C have a high gloss. The rheological properties of the 7010C enable the production of full tone formulations at 10 % pigment loading. This pigment can be used pure or in combination for example with our very opaque lysopac Red 4841C, to formulate most of the red shades on the market. In a 50/50 pigment dry proportion, it offers an excellent Florida exposure (24 months - black box, 5°), in both alkyd melamine and acrylic 2 component systems. It has an excellent dispersibility and does not necessarily need wetting agents or additives to improve the rheological properties of the paint.",Chemical nature

"The Rockwood Pigments’ High-Heat Tan series is most commonly used in plastics. High temperature stability and ease of dispersion make these pigments suitable for resin systems from LLDPE and vinyl to sophisticated engineering polymers and silicone rubber compounds. Interactions of pigment and some resins in high-temp plastics compounding can lead to slight color shifts. Suitability of tan pigments should be verified for specific applications. Exterior durability is improved by the ultraviolet screening properties contributed by these pigments, especially with polymers that are sensitive to sunlight. The High-Heat Tan product line is characterized as providing advantages in the following areas:",Pigment treatment

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

"The paste should be pre-soaked in a solvent at a paste:solvent ratio of between 1:1 to 3:1. Polar solvents should be avoided with leafing grades due to their adverse effect on leafing stability. Pre-soaking generally takes from one to eight hours. Finer grades typically take longer than coarser grades. Use low shear, slow speed mixing to achieve a smooth consistency free of agglomerates. High shear dispersion techniques should be avoided, as they will distort the aluminum flakes.",multi

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive opposed to classical scattering pigments which are subtractive. Blending of dissimilar colors will reduce the reflection chromaticity. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments their appearance will change with background color. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles. The addition of strongly absorbing or scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments will reduce the reflection and transmission properties of the effect pigments.,multi

"Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive but will be adversely diminished with absorptive effect pigments or scattering classical pigments. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments, absorption of the transmission color with either dark substrates or absorption pigments is necessary. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles only. Because effect pigments use absorption, transmission and reflection, scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments tend to impair the effect.",multi
