DECOMET® Suspension is compatible with many common binders for solvent based inks. Suitability for end application and formulation stability should be fully tested on any new formulation prior to use. Resins such as Nitrocellulose or CAB with high clarity and gloss are recommended to achieve the best possible mirror effect. It is also important to keep resin solids to a minimum. A pigment to resin solids ratio of between 1:1 or 2:1 is recommended to maximize surface reflectance.,Pigment Treatment

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

"use in water-based formulations | Paliocrom® Sparkling Red L 3505 was developed for solvent-based systems. For water- based formulations it requires further stabilization by the user. Our experience shows that additional stabilization is essential when Paliocrom® Sparkling Red L 3505 is to be combined with transparent iron oxides or micro titanium pigments (transparent titanium dioxide). Passivators used with aluminum pigments are the first choice of stabilizers. We achieved very good results with Korantin® SMK, an acidic phosphoric monoester, adding 2.5 % in terms of solid Paliocrom® pigment. Vigorously stirring, add 50.0 parts of Paliocrom Sparkling Red L 3505 to 49.2 parts of butyl glycol, stir for further 10 minutes. Stir in 0.8 parts of passivator (e.g. Korantin® SMK).

The particle size distribution range is controlled to produce clean chromatic effects when used with transparent pigments and dyes. This grade will produce strong metallic effects with coarse grain aesthetics when used alone or with other pigments. Sparkle Silvet 760-20-E is suitable for use in both plastics and powder coatings applications. -Coarse particle size, cornflake",Supply Form

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 6% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi

DECOMET® Suspension is compatible with many common binders for solvent based inks. Suitability for end application and formulation stability should be fully tested on any new formulation prior to use. Resins such as Nitrocellulose or CAB with high clarity and gloss are recommended to achieve the best possible mirror effect. It is also important to keep resin solids to a minimum. A pigment to resin solids ratio of between 1:1 or 2:1 is recommended to maximize surface reflectance in gravure printing.,Pigment Treatment

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using SPARKLE SILVET products f or manuf acturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the f lake and to allow f or saf e incorporation. The blending of the SPARKLE SILVET with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the SPARKLE SILVET pellets should be added at the v ery end of a high intensity mixer cy cle. The objectiv e of mixing is only to distribute the SPARKLE SILVET throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to f ine particles. When discharging the batch f rom the mixer to the extruder, the v essels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prev ent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to prov ide proper dispersion of the SPARKLE SILVET into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessiv e shear at any point in this process can cause f lakes to become f olded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller f lakes. This will result in a reduced ref lectiv ity of the f lakes and a gray ing in color.",multi

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

"Both the leafing and water grades can be used in solvent-based systems. Leafing pigments are capable of concentrating at the surface of a paint film, where parti- cles overlap each other (as shown in the photograph), creating a metallic appearance. Water grade pigments are non-leafing in solvent systems and are randomly dispersed. This allows for light to be reflected off the metallic flakes and display the hue of the transparent color pigment.",Aluminium Type

"The dispersion must try to achieve the complete separation of each flake in order to obtain a maximum metallic effect of the pigment. One recommended method is to prepare a master batch using two parts of paste and butanol, or butyl acetate, in a container where it can be slowly mixed (maximum: 80 RPM). The use of the mentioned solvents shall apply only in those cases where they are compatible with the vehicle that will be used, but they can be replaced by other solvents, more common, like toluol, xylol, or high flash, with or without mineral spirit. If possible, these solvents should also be mixed with polar solvents, so as not to interfere with the non leafing properties of the pigments.",Aluminium Type

"Silvex® 223-20-C is a fine particle size aluminum pigment dampened with mineral oil to minimize the potential for generating airborne pigment particles. This is an economical grade with cornflake geometry and wide particle size distribution range. Due to its fine particle size and broad particle size distribution, this grade is well suited for imparting opacity at low loading levels. This is an economical grade and can be used to create a muted masstone metallic appearance with good opacity at low cost. This grade is not recommended for use with chromatic pigments as it will not produce clean color effects. Although grade is based on leafing aluminum pigment, it will not exhibit leafing characteristics in most plastic applications.",Aluminium Type

"Both the leafing and water grades can be used in solvent-based systems. Leafing pigments are capable of concentrating at the surface of a paint film, where parti- cles overlap each other (as shown in the photograph), creating a metallic appearance. Water grade pigments are non-leafing in solvent systems and are randomly dispersed. This allows for light to be reflected off the metallic flakes and display the hue of the transparent color pigment.",Aluminium Type

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product.

"Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) is a new, mid shade red effect pigment with high lightness and chroma. It is based on iron oxide coated, passivated aluminum flakes of a thin silver-dollar type with approximately 17 µ medium particle size. The smaller particle size allows good hiding and excellent DOI (Distinctiveness of Images) of automotive basecoats. Especially the tremendous chroma and lightness of Paliocrom® Brilliant Red allows completely new, brilliant red effect shades with good hiding. Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) can be used both in solvent- and waterborne paint systems. It contains an additional surface treatment with an organo-silane compound which leads to a significant better stability in water-borne systems.",Substrate

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary.

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) is a new, mid shade red effect pigment with high lightness and chroma. It is based on iron oxide coated, passivated aluminum flakes of a thin silver-dollar type with approximately 17 µ medium particle size. The smaller particle size allows good hiding and excellent DOI (Distinctiveness of Images) of automotive basecoats. Especially the tremendous chroma and lightness of Paliocrom® Brilliant Red allows completely new, brilliant red effect shades with good hiding. Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) can be used both in solvent- and waterborne paint systems. It contains an additional surface treatment with an organo-silane compound which leads to a significant better stability in water-borne systems.",Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary.

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

The high metal content has been chosen to maximise formulation flexibility whilst ensuring good dispersibility in a wide range of thermoplastics. Suitable polymers include styrenics, polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters, polycarbonate and acetals. Use with certain grades of EVA and PVC may also be possible, but compatibility tests are recommended. ST 210-30-E1 is recommended for use at 0.5-1% w/w on polymer to provide a solid metallic effect in coloured metallic formulations. When used alone, a loading of up to 2% may be required for colour saturation and opacity.",Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate.

"Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) is a new, mid shade red effect pigment with high lightness and chroma. It is based on iron oxide coated, passivated aluminum flakes of a thin silver-dollar type with approximately 17 µ medium particle size. The smaller particle size allows good hiding and excellent DOI (Distinctiveness of Images) of automotive basecoats. Especially the tremendous chroma and lightness of Paliocrom® Brilliant Red allows completely new, brilliant red effect shades with good hiding. Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) can be used both in solvent- and waterborne paint systems. It contains an additional surface treatment with an organo-silane compound which leads to a significant better stability in water-borne systems.",Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) is a new, mid shade red effect pigment with high lightness and chroma. It is based on iron oxide coated, passivated aluminum flakes of a thin silver-dollar type with approximately 17 µ medium particle size. The smaller particle size allows good hiding and excellent DOI (Distinctiveness of Images) of automotive basecoats. Especially the tremendous chroma and lightness of Paliocrom® Brilliant Red allows completely new, brilliant red effect shades with good hiding. Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) can be used both in solvent- and waterborne paint systems.

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) is a new, mid shade red effect pigment with high lightness and chroma. It is based on iron oxide coated, passivated aluminum flakes of a thin silver-dollar type with approximately 17 µ medium particle size. The smaller particle size allows good hiding and excellent DOI (Distinctiveness of Images) of automotive basecoats. Especially the tremendous chroma and lightness of Paliocrom® Brilliant Red allows completely new, brilliant red effect shades with good hiding. Paliocrom® Brilliant Red EH 1000 (L 3258) can be used both in solvent- and waterborne paint systems. It contains an additional surface treatment with an organo-silane compound which leads to a significant better stability in water-borne systems.",Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary.

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary. It is not recommended to grind effect pigments by using mechanical mills or high speed dispersers.",Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

"Dispersion of effect pigments is a key for effect pigment performance within a coating. Electrostatic or steric stabilization may be employed to achieve desired formulation stability. Effect pigments may be pre-mixed at 25-35% mica based effect pigment with 65-75% vehicle solids using low shear mixing for 15-30 minutes. This slurry may be then added to the final paint formulation. If settling or hard packing occurs due to relatively high specific gravity of mica effect pigments, a proper formulation using anti- settling agents such as Attagel® 50 or Byk®1 410 with circulation may be necessary.

"ST 210-30-E1 provides a very fine particle size aluminium flake pigment in an easily handled, low dusting, meterable delivery form. The high metal content has been chosen to maximise formulation flexibility whilst ensuring good dispersibility in a wide range of thermoplastics. Suitable polymers include styrenics, polyolefins, polyamides, polyesters, polycarbonate and acetals. Use with certain grades of EVA and PVC may also be possible, but compatibility tests are recommended. ST 210-30-E1 is recommended for use at 0.5-1% w/w on polymer to provide a solid metallic effect in coloured metallic formulations. When used alone, a loading of up to 2% may be required for colour saturation and opacity.",Substrate

As with all effect pigments the amount of material used is primarily dependant upon the look that you are trying to achieve with the final part. The recommended final loading is 1% - 3%. Concentrates can be made as high as 30%. The dispersion of the pigment requires low shear to avoid fracturing of the mica substrate. Generally a single screw or non aggressive twin screw configuration is recommended. Subjecting the mica to high shear forces will reduce the luster of the final product. In some cases the effect pigment can be placed directly into the molding machine prior to final part production skipping the extrusion process.,Substrate

For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added.

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added.

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 4% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form
"Sparkle Silvet® 760-20-E is a coarse particle size, Sparkle Silver® aluminum pigment produced in pellet form to reduce the potential for generating airborne particles and to improve ease of handling. The pellets are produced by a low shear process for easy dispersion. The pigment flake has a polished cornflake geometry. The particle size distribution range is controlled to produce clean chromatic effects when used with transparent pigments and dyes. This grade will produce strong metallic effects with coarse grain aesthetics when used alone or with other pigments.

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes.

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size.

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi

"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi
