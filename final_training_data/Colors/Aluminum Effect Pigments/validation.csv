"Co-Extruded Powder Application - When using Sparkle Silvet® products for manufacturing powder coatings, care must be taken to maintain the aesthetics of the flake and to allow for safe incorporation. The blending of the Sparkle Silvet® with the powder coating resins should be carried out in a low intensity mixer. If this cannot be accomplished, the Sparkle Silvet® pellets should be added at the very end of a high intensity mixer cycle. The objective of mixing is only to distribute the Sparkle Silvet® throughout the batch and not to reduce the pellets to fine particles. When discharging the batch from the mixer to the extruder, the vessels should be bonded to the same electrical potential to prevent static electricity build up. Single or twin-screw extruders can then be used to provide proper dispersion of the Sparkle Silvet® into the powder coating resin. The metallic blend should be extruded below the curing temperature of the resin and then micronized to the proper size. Excessive shear at any point in this process can cause flakes to become folded or broken, thus creating a large number of smaller flakes. This will result in a reduced reflectivity of the flakes and a graying in color.",multi

"Novamet Stainless Steel Flake is produced from Type 316L stainless steel. This premium-quality stainless steel combines excellent corrosion resistance with outstanding abrasion resist- ance and toughness. Not only does it resist salt spray and acid spotting but it is also unaffected by strong alkaline cleaners and detergents. It will not chalk or tarnish. Along with good corrosion resistance, stainless steel flake has high specular reflectance, making it ideally suited for such applications as pigments for powder coatings and high-performance paints. Lower Explosive Limits. Tests conducted by an independent laboratory show stainless steel to be stable in powder coat- ings. The US Bureau of Mines categorizes explosion hazards of materials as None, Weak, Moderate, Strong and Severe. Stainless Steel falls into the “none” Category.",Supply Form

"For powder coatings, the packaging should be cut open and the pigment gently combined at up to 5% loading with the powder coating to provide a ready- to-spray composition. For liquid coatings, the bag may be cut open and the contents allowed to discharge gently onto the surface of the solvent. If using solvent alone is not feasible, the medium can be substituted, but dispersion time may be extended. Dispersion is best achieved by low energy stirring, using a blade capable of moving the whole mass. Further solvent or medium may be added at this stage. When a smooth consistency, free of aggregates has been obtained, the remainder of the formulation can be slowly added. High shear should be avoided as it causes flake damage, thereby reducing brightness. Gassing resistance in water-based media will also be reduced.",Supply Form

"Color styling with transparent interference effect pigments is additive but will be adversely diminished with absorptive effect pigments or scattering classical pigments. Due to the transparency of mica based effect pigments, absorption of the transmission color with either dark substrates or absorption pigments is necessary. Light or white backgrounds will reflect the transmission color at aspecular angles only. Because effect pigments use absorption, transmission and reflection, scattering pigments such as inorganic pigments tend to impair the effect.",multi
